<p style="text-align: justify;" markdown="1">In my experience with Unity 3d, I have developed a story based structure in which anyone can use to develop a story for their games. It includes a template which anyone can grab and use it as a system. Feel free to grab the source code from my [Github Repo](https://github.com/richmondgoh8/AStoryAdventure). You can also proceed to view a short story developed using my system via the itch.io. You can view my game at [Unity Story Adventure](https://richmondgoh8.itch.io/the-great-escape).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" markdown="1">I have also created 2 games with my team using Zero Engine and they are namely swirl; a movement recording based game and demonice; a game where the player will try to balance his life on a very thin life. Feel free to view the source code at [ZeroEngine - Demonice & Swirl](https://github.com/richmondgoh8/Swirl_Zero_Demonice) or download the .exe file at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BzffX1_lPaINZFJJTS0tNzM1UTQ)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" markdown="1">I have also tinkered with Corona SDK using Lua Language and built 3 Android Mobile Applications namely "Fit4Life", "SleepTight" and "Daily Dose"</p>
</br>

<p style="text-align: justify;" markdown="1">Beside all these, I write blogs, participate in hackathons, attend Meetups during my spare time. If you would be interested to work with me, feel free to either drop me an email via **richmondgoh@gmail.com**. I have also written game reviews and the analysis of them in-depth which you can view at [Published Papers](http://sp.academia.edu/RichmondGoh).</p>
