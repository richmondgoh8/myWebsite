#### In my experience with unity 3d, I have developed a story based structure in which anyone can use to develop a story for their games. It includes an template which anyone can grab and use it as a system. Feel free to grab the source code from my [Github Repo](https://github.com/richmondgoh8/AStoryAdventure). You can also proceed to view a short story developed using my system via the itch.io. You can view my game at [Unity Story Adventure](https://richmondgoh8.itch.io/the-great-escape).
</br>
#### I have also created 2 games with my team using Zero Engine and they are namely swirl; a movement recording based game and demonice; a game where the player will try to balance his life on a very thin life. Feel free to view the source code at [ZeroEngine - Demonice & Swirl](https://github.com/richmondgoh8/Swirl_Zero_Demonice) or download the .exe file at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BzffX1_lPaINZFJJTS0tNzM1UTQ)

#### During my spare time, I have tinekred with Corona SDK using Lua Language to build 2 IOS mobile applications namely "Catch The Beat 2" and "Lost Sense". Catch The Beat 2 revolves arounds the player trying to prevent music from dying in the virtual world. It seeks to test the player's reaction skills. A demo of the game can be found in [IOS App - Catch The Beat 2](https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/catch-the-beat-2/id1023323140?mt=8). You can also download Lost Sense at [IOS App - Lost Sense](https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/lost-sense/id995634840?mt=8) which simply makes use of the weather api to inform the user of the weather in Singapore and allow them to plan their schedule accordingly to catch either the sunrise or sunset!
</br>
#### Beside all these, I write blogs, participate in hackathons, attend meetups during my spare time. If you would be interested to work with me, feel free to either drop me an email via the [contact form](/contact) or read about some articles that I have written on my [blog](/blog). I have also written game reviews and the analysis of them in-depth which you can view at [Published Papers](http://sp.academia.edu/RichmondGoh).
