## Introduction
Death is a mystery. It is a scary darkness that is almost impossible to fanthom.

How can we extend our life way beyond the natural lifespan apart from uploading our conscience into the net or making use of [cryopreservation][1]. One possible way we could do this is by reducing our biological age to ensure that our system is always up and running together with some tissue regeneration.
