      <description>Sneak Preview Today&amp;rsquo;s Topic will be all about Continuous Integration for Hugo Deployment! Click on the link to find out more but in a nutshell, it is a pretty neat tool for hosting a static website! The thing is that now that you are done creating your website with Hugo tool in localhost.

After browsing tutorials after tutorials and scanning through providers, i realized that hosting providers are definitely not the way to go and to keep cost low, I have decided to use Amazon S3 Storage.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Death is a mystery. It is a scary darkness that is almost impossible to fanthom.
