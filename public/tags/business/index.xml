      <description>Sample Corona Projects Before I begin, I thought I should start out by showing you some screenshots of the application that I have created! Namely: Sleep Tight and The Daily Dose.
What Do I Use Corona For? Currently, I primarily use Corona SDK for Business Mobile Application in which I publish onto the Google Play Store.
