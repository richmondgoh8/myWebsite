      <description>Sample Corona Projects Before I begin, I thought I should start out by showing you some screenshots of the application that I have created! Namely: Sleep Tight and The Daily Dose.
What Do I Use Corona For? Currently, I primarily use Corona SDK for Business Mobile Application in which I publish onto the Google Play Store.
Is Corona Worth Learning? Currently Corona SDK is primarily used with Lua Programming Language which is easy to learn.</description>

      <description>Sneak Preview Today&amp;rsquo;s Topic will be all about Continuous Integration for Hugo Deployment! Click on the link to find out more but in a nutshell, it is a pretty neat tool for hosting a static website! The thing is that now that you are done creating your website with Hugo tool in localhost. You are ready to let it run public for the whole wide world to know! After browsing tutorials after tutorials and scanning through providers, i realized that hosting providers are definitely not the way to go and to keep cost low, I have decided to use Amazon S3 Storage.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Death is a mystery. It is a scary darkness that is almost impossible to fanthom. If life is like a game, some people think that you would respawn in a different place, some people think that you replay the good bits of life in your brain over again, some people think that you enter a different dimension.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Initially, I have been using Web Hosting Hub with wordpress installed with it to run my website. I got my domain name from OpenSRS. I am quite happy with their services and support. However, It has come to the point that I am clearly paying too much for just hosting a blog which stood at about 13 bucks a month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
