<h3 id="1-what-is-this-blog-all-about">1. WHAT IS THIS BLOG ALL ABOUT?</h3>

<p>This blog will not just be about reducing your biological age, keep yourself healthy and will also aim to keep you in the loop about the technological world that we are currently exposed to. I will host some of the projects that I have completed on github.com and will leave the links in the pages.</p>

<h3 id="2-what-kind-of-technology-have-you-played-with">2. WHAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGY HAVE YOU PLAYED WITH?</h3>

<p>Languages that I have tinkered with involves:
* Golang
* C#
* Lua
* Javascript, HTML, CSS
* Python
* Ruby</p>

<h3 id="3-sdk-that-you-work-with">3. SDK THAT YOU WORK WITH?</h3>

<p>So far, I have worked with Corona SDK, Unity 3D, Titanium, Zero Engine, Wordpress, Hugo</p>

<h3 id="4-how-do-you-seek-to-attain-immortality-prolonged-life">4. HOW DO YOU SEEK TO ATTAIN IMMORTALITY/ PROLONGED LIFE?</h3>

<p>I believed that we are judged not by our real age, but by our biological age. Having a biological age of 50 but a real age of 25 will still hamper you from living a long life. In my blog, I will proceed to share my journey to reducing my biological age, balancing your weight issues and having an active lifestyle. The tips shared with you will be doable with a hectic lifestyle.</p>

<h3 id="5-how-are-your-content-managed">5. HOW ARE YOUR CONTENT MANAGED</h3>

<p>I will categorize the content available in my blog with a #something in the title, you can search for the relevant subjects via the search function which is &ldquo;ctrl f&rdquo;</p>
